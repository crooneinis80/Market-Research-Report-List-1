<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Plastic Ventilation Fan market is primarily categorized into two types: axial and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, making them efficient for applications requiring high airflow at low pressure, such as residential spaces or greenhouses. In contrast, centrifugal fans draw air in at a right angle and release it at high pressure, making them suitable for industrial settings where airflow resistance is greater, such as HVAC systems and exhaust applications. Each type serves distinct ventilation needs based on requirements.</p></p>
